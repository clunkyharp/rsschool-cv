##An example of code that I have implemented.

####Description of task:

Create a function which answers the question "Are you playing banjo?".
If your name starts with the letter "R" or lower case "r", you are playing banjo!

The function takes a name as its only argument, and returns one of the following strings.

####Solution:
function areYouPlayingBanjo(name) {
	if (name[0].toLowerCase() === "r") {
		return `${name} plays banjo`;
	} else {
		return `${name} does not play banjo`;
	}
}
